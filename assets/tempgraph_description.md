### Structural monitoring powered by the structure itself! 
The above graph shows a live feed of temperature data updated once every minute at the  [Alfa Laval Innovation House](https://www.alfalaval.dk/info/denmark/innovation-house/) in SÃ¸borg, Denmark. By simply sticking the ["SensEver Alfa"](https://www.tegnology.dk/sensever-alfa/) power supply from [TEGnology ApS](https://www.tegnology.dk/) to the outside wall of the office building, we can convert the temperature difference between the building surface and the surrounding air into a steady 3.3V power supply which we then use to power a [WATTECO Remote Temperature 2](https://support.watteco.com/remote-temperature-2/) LoRaWan transmitter that includes two temperature sensors. The data is continuously transmitted via a nearby connected [LoRaWAN gateway](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/gateways/models/thethingsindoorgateway/) to the [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) platform. We store the data using [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and display it in this [python powered dashboard](https://github.com/Dahlia-Dry/TEGnology-dashboard) hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home).
